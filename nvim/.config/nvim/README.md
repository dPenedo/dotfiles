# My NeoVim config

This is my NeoVim config. At the beginning I builded it with [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and it follows a structure similar to [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
It has some custom **snippets** for:
    - JavaScript
- Python
- **Markdown**: lalal:
    - lala


Plugins and colorschemes that I don't use are saved on `.archive` directories.

- lalal:
    - lalal:
        - lslsl:
            - lalal
