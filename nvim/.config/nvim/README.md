# My NeoVim config

This is my NeoVim config. At the beginning I builded it with [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and it follows a structure similar to [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
It has some custom *snippets* for:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Markdown:

Plugins and colorschemes that I don't use are saved on `.archive` directories.
